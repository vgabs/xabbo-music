# Xabbo Music
A G-Earth extension that allows you to create and play music in Habbo Hotel using SFX furni and wired automation.

## 🎵 How It Works
SFX furni in Habbo plays different notes based on its height. By arranging these furni in the correct order and timing, you can compose and play songs inside your room.

Xabbo Music maps the notes from most SFX furni, allowing you to drag and arrange them on a timeline to create melodies. Once your song is ready, click the **Builder's Club** button to automatically place the furni in your room.

## 🎼 Timeline Features
### 🔍 Zoom
By default, the timeline speed is **50ms**, meaning each tile represents a 50ms interval. You can zoom out to increase the spacing between notes for better visualization.

### 🔵 Blue Markers
When zoomed out, some notes may not be visible due to timeline speed. If a note exists between two tiles, a **blue marker** will appear to indicate its presence.

### ▶️ Play
If you're connected to Habbo and inside a room, you can preview your song by clicking the **Play** button.

## 🏗️ Building a Song in Your Room
After finalizing your song, click the **Builder's Club** button to generate the setup in your room.

You'll then set the position where the furni will be placed manually:
- **Select an item** and **left-click** to place it.
- **Right-click** a selected tile to remove it.

### 🎚️ SFX & Magic Tile
- The **Magic Tile** is used to elevate SFX furni. It must be placed correctly for the system to work.
- If the Magic Tile **cannot be placed** at the SFX furni's position, the setup will fail.
- You can get the **Magic Tile ID** by clicking on it when G-Earth is connected:

### 🎛️ Controller
The **controller** is represented by a glowing ball in the room. It moves upward slowly, triggering the wired conditions for each note. 

> **Important:** Place the controller on a tile that is **not elevated** (default tile height: `:floor`).
